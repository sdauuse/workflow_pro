# Frontend-Backend Integration Issues - Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. âœ… FIXED: Calendar Selection Not Working (DatePicker)
**Problem**: DatePicker showed "ant-picker-invalid" state and calendar selection didn't work
**Solution**: Added proper onChange handlers, placeholder text, and allowClear props to both DatePickers in ProjectForm.js

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/ProjectForm.js` - Enhanced DatePicker components for nextCheckDate and nearMilestoneDate

### 2. âœ… FIXED: Modal Deprecation Warning 
**Problem**: destroyOnClose is deprecated in newer Ant Design versions
**Solution**: Replaced destroyOnClose with destroyInnerComponentOnClose

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/MilestoneList.js`
- `frontend/src/components/MilestoneListNew.js`

### 3. âœ… FIXED: Team Update API 400 Bad Request Error
**Problem**: Frontend sent memberIds field which is not part of Team model, causing JSON deserialization failure
**Solution**: Separated team basic info update from member assignment update

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Modified handleUpdateTeam to separate basic team data from member assignments

### 4. âœ… FIXED: Milestone Completion 405 Method Not Allowed
**Problem**: Backend missing PATCH endpoint for milestone completion
**Solution**: Added new endpoint `/milestones/{id}/complete` in KeyMilestoneController

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/main/java/com/company/projectmanagement/controller/KeyMilestoneController.java`

### 5. âœ… ADDRESSED: PATCH Method Support
**Problem**: PATCH method not supported for milestone completion
**Solution**: Added proper PATCH endpoint with @PatchMapping annotation

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Fixes:
1. DatePicker calendar selection enhanced with proper event handlers
2. Modal deprecation warnings resolved
3. Team update API logic separated for basic info vs member assignments
4. Milestone completion endpoint added to backend controller

### ðŸ”„ Requires Backend Restart:
The new milestone completion endpoint requires restarting the backend service to take effect.

### ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist:

1. **DatePicker Functionality**:
   - [ ] Open Project Form (create or edit)
   - [ ] Click on "Next Check Date" or "Near Milestone Date" fields
   - [ ] Verify calendar opens and dates can be selected
   - [ ] Check that invalid state is cleared

2. **Modal Components**:
   - [ ] Open milestone edit modals
   - [ ] Verify no console warnings about destroyOnClose

3. **Team Updates**:
   - [ ] Edit a team with new name/description
   - [ ] Update team members
   - [ ] Verify both updates work without 400 errors

4. **Milestone Completion**:
   - [ ] Try to mark a milestone as completed
   - [ ] Verify the action works without 405 errors

## Backend Changes Required

The backend controller has been updated but needs a restart to take effect. If you cannot restart the backend, the milestone completion can temporarily use the status update endpoint instead:

**Alternative frontend fix** (if backend restart not possible):
```javascript
// In milestoneService.js, replace completeMilestone method:
async completeMilestone(id) {
    try {
        const response = await this.api.patch(`/milestones/${id}/status?status=COMPLETED`);
        return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error completing milestone ${id}:`, error);
        throw error;
    }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Restart backend service to activate new milestone completion endpoint
2. Test all fixed functionalities
3. Monitor console for any remaining errors
4. Verify API responses are as expected

All frontend fixes are immediately active and should resolve the reported issues.
